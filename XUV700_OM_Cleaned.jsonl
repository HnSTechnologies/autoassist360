{"text": "TYRE INFORMATION"}
{"text": "SEE OWNER\u2019S MANUAL FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONProper Tyre inflation pressure is essential to the safe and satisfactory operation of your vehicle. Three primary areas are affected by improper Tyre pressure:"}
{"text": "Safety"}
{"text": "Economy"}
{"text": "Ride Comfort and Vehicle Stability"}
{"text": "Proper Tyre inflation contributes to a comfortable and safe ride. Over-inflation produces a jarring and uncomfortable ride. Both under-inflation and over-inflation affect the stability of the vehicle and can produce a feeling of sluggish response or over responsiveness in the steering. Unequal Tyre pressures can cause erratic and unpredictable steering response or may cause the vehicle to drift left or right."}
{"text": "Improper inflation pressures can cause uneven wear patterns to develop across the Tyre tread. These abnormal wear patterns will reduce tread life resulting in a need for earlier Tyre replacement. Under inflation also increases Tyre rolling resistance and results in higher fuel consumption."}
{"text": "The proper cold Tyre inflation pressure is listed in the Tyre Label (Vehicle Placard), located on the front passenger side inner B-pillar."}
{"text": "Inspection and Adjustment Procedure"}
{"text": "The Tyre pressure should be checked and adjusted, as well as inspected for signs of Tyre wear or visible damage, at least once a month. Use a good quality pressure gauge to check Tyre pressure. Do not make a visual judgement when determining proper inflation. Radial Tyres may look properly inflated even when they are underinflated. At the same time, each Tyre should be inspected for signs of Tyre wear or visible damage."}
{"text": "Inflation pressures specified on the placard are always cold Tyre inflation pressures. Cold Tyre inflation pressure is defined as the Tyre pressure after the vehicle has not been driven for at least three hours, or driven less than 1 km after a three-hour period. Check Tyre pressures more often if subject to a wide range of outdoor temperatures, as Tyre pressures vary with temperature changes. Tyre pressures change by approximately 1 psi (7 kPa) per 7\u00b0 C of air temperature change. Keep this in mind when checking Tyre pressure inside a garage, especially in the winter."}
{"text": "When it was new, the spare Tyre in your vehicle was fully inflated. However, a spare Tyre can lose pressure over time. In order to avoid being stranded, check the spare Tyre air pressure frequently."}
{"text": "Inflating Your Tyres"}
{"text": "Safe operation of your vehicle requires that your Tyres are properly inflated. Remember that a Tyre can lose up to half of its air pressure without appearing flat."}
{"text": "At least once a month or before long trips, inspect each Tyre and check the Tyre pressure with a Tyre gauge (including spare Tyre). Inflate all Tyres to the recommended inflation pressure."}
{"text": "Under-inflation is the most common cause of Tyre failures and may result in severe Tyre cracking, tread separation or \u201cblowout\u201d, with unexpected loss of vehicle control and increased risk of injury. Under-inflation increases sidewall flexing and rolling resistance, resulting in heat buildup and internal damage to the Tyre. It also may result in unnecessary Tyre stress, irregular wear, loss of vehicle control and accidents."}
{"text": "Over or under inflation may reduce the tyre life"}
{"text": "Do not correct the tyre pressure immediately after the vehicle is stopped after operation, server handling or long distance drive. Check the inflation pressure when the vehicle is idle for 3 hours or 10 minutes of driving after 3 hours in idle condition"}
{"text": "Do not drive the vehicle with lower pressure than recommended, which may lead to over heating of sidewall resulting in tyre damage"}
{"text": "Check the tyre pressures once in a month or before long distance travels"}
{"text": "Check your tyres regularly for any damages or cut on the sidewall. Please replace the tyres immediately."}
{"text": "Always inflate your Tyres to the recommended pressure even if it is less than the maximum inflation pressure information found on the Tyre. The recommended Tyre inflation pressure is found on the Tyre Label which is located on the front passenger side inner B-pillar. Failure to follow the Tyre pressure recommendations can cause uneven tread wear patterns and adversely affect the way your vehicle handles."}
{"text": "If you overfill the Tyre, release air by pushing the metal stem in the centre of the valve. Then recheck the pressure."}
{"text": "After inspecting or adjusting the Tyre pressure, always reinstal the valve stem cap (if equipped). This will prevent moisture and dirt from entering the valve stem, which could damage the stem, resulting in an unexpected loss of Tyre pressure, an accident and/or personal injury."}
{"text": "Radial Ply Tyres"}
{"text": "Combining radial ply Tyres with other types of Tyres on your vehicle will cause your vehicle to handle poorly, resulting in an accident and/or personal injury. Always use radial Tyres in sets of four. Never combine them with other types of Tyres."}
{"text": "Cuts and punctures in radial Tyres are repairable only in the tread area because of sidewall flexing. Consult your Mahindra Authorised Dealer for radial Tyre repairs."}
{"text": "Tread Wear Indicators (TWI)"}
{"text": "Tread wear indicators are moulded into the bottom of the tread grooves. They will appear as bands when the tread depth becomes 1/16 inch (2 mm). When the indicators appear in two or more adjacent grooves, the Tyre should be replaced."}
{"text": "Avoid abrupt manoeuvring and braking. This can cause Tyre deterioration and lead to loss of steering or braking control."}
{"text": "Life of Tyre"}
{"text": "The service life of a Tyre is dependent upon various factors including but not limited to:"}
{"text": "Driving style"}
{"text": "Tyre pressure"}
{"text": "Distance driven"}
{"text": "Tyres and the spare Tyre should be replaced after six years, regardless of the remaining tread. Failure to follow this warning can result in sudden and unexpected Tyre failure, leading to an accident and/or personal injury."}
{"text": "Keep dismounted Tyres in a cool, dry place with as little exposure to light as possible. Protect Tyres from contact with oil, grease and fuels."}
{"text": "Do not use a Tyre, wheel size or speed rating other than that specified for your vehicle on the Tyre placard. Combinations of unapproved Tyres and wheels may change suspension geometric and performance characteristics, resulting in changes to steering, handling and braking of your vehicle. This can cause unpredictable handling, stress to steering"}

{"text": "Your vehicle has been designed for fewer maintenance requirements with longer service intervals to save both your time and money. However, each regular maintenance, as well as day-to-day care is more important to ensure a smooth, trouble-free, safe and economical operation. It is the owner's responsibility to make sure the specified maintenance, including general maintenance service is performed. Note that both the new vehicle limited warranty and emission control system limited warranties specify that proper maintenance and care must be performed. See Warranty and Service Information Guide for complete warranty information."}
{"text": "Where to go for service?"}
{"text": "Mahindra technicians are well trained specialists and are kept up to date with the latest service information through technical bulletins, service tips and in dealership training programmes. They learn to work on Mahindra vehicles before they work on your vehicle, rather than while they are working on it."}
{"text": "You can be confident that your Mahindra Authorised Dealer service department does the best job to meet the maintenance requirements on your vehicle reliably and economically."}
{"text": "Get the most from your vehicle with routine maintenance: Routine maintenance is the best way to help ensure you get the performance, dependability, long life and better resale value you expect from your vehicle. This is exactly why we've put together this Maintenance Section. It outlines the services required to properly maintain your vehicle and when they should be performed. The focus is on maintaining your vehicle while it's running great, which goes a long way toward preventing major repairs and expenses later."}
{"text": "Here are a few suggestions to help you get started on routine maintenance:"}

{"text": "Prepare for the Appointment: If you have warranty work to be done, be sure to have the right papers with you. All work to be performed may not be covered by the warranty."}
{"text": "Discuss additional charges with the service manager. Keep a maintenance log of your vehicle's service history."}
{"text": "Prepare a List: Make a written list of your vehicle's problems or the specific work you want done. If you've had an accident or work done that is not on your maintenance log, let the Service adviser/Relationship manager know about it."}
{"text": "Be Reasonable with Requests: If your list has several items and you must have your vehicle by the end of the day, discuss the situation with the Service adviser/Relationship manager and list the items in order of priority."}
{"text": "Need Assistance? : It is recommended talking to an Mahindra Authorised Dealer service manager first. Most matters can be resolved with this process. If for some reason you are still not satisfied, talk to the general manager or owner of the dealership."}
{"text": "If an Mahindra Authorised Dealer is unable to resolve the concern, you may contact any Mahindra Customer Care Executive. They would need the following information:"}
{"text": "Owner's name and address, owner's telephone number (home and office), Mahindra Authorised Dealer name, Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), vehicle delivery date and mileage."}
{"text": "Warranty Information: Read the Warranty Information given in the \u2018Warranty and Service Information Guide\u2019 for"}
{"text": "the terms and provisions of Mahindra warranties applicable to this vehicle. Mahindra genuine parts, fluids, lubricants and accessories are available at any Mahindra Authorised Dealer. They will help keep the vehicle operating at its best."}
{"text": "Protect your Warranty: Routine maintenance is not only the best way to help keep your vehicle performing as intended, it's also the best way to protect your warranty. Failure to perform scheduled maintenance specified in the warranty and Service Information Guide will invalidate warranty coverage on parts affected by the lack of maintenance. We can't stress enough how important it is to keep records of all maintenance. Damage or failures due to neglect or lack of proper maintenance are not covered under warranty."}
{"text": "Keeping maintenance records is easy with the \u2018Warranty and Service Information Guide\u2019"}
{"text": "It's important to document the maintenance of your vehicle. For your convenience to maintain records of service, the scheduled maintenance coupons are provided in the service coupon booklet. Every time you bring your vehicle in for scheduled maintenance, be sure to present this booklet and certify the work. Also record the date of service and mileage at the time of service. This will make record keeping easy and, should your vehicle ever require warranty coverage, you will have all the documentation to show you've properly maintained it."}
{"text": "Oils, Fluids and Flushing: In many cases, fluid discoloration is a normal operating characteristic by itself, and does not necessarily indicate a concern or that the fluid needs to be changed. However, discolored fluids that also show signs of overheating and/or foreign material contamination should be inspected immediately by a qualified expert such as the factory trained technicians at your Mahindra Authorised Dealer. Your vehicle's oils and fluids should be changed at the specified intervals or in conjunction with a repair."}
{"text": "Chemicals and Additives: Non-Mahindra approved chemicals or additives are not required for factory recommended maintenance. In fact, Mahindra recommends against the use of such additive products unless specifically recommended by Mahindra for a particular application."}
{"text": "Your vehicle is very sophisticated and built with multiple complex performance systems. Every manufacturer develops these systems using different specifications and performance features. That's why it's important to rely on your Mahindra Authorised Dealer to properly diagnose and repair your vehicle."}
{"text": "When planning your maintenance services, consider your Mahindra Authorised Dealer for all your vehicle's needs."}
{"text": "Get the most from your Service and Maintenance visits: Getting your vehicle serviced at an Mahindra Authorised Dealer adds great value to your vehicle in number of ways. Hence, it is recommended to service your vehicle at an Mahindra Authorised Dealer only."}
{"text": "Maintenance Interval: Mahindra establishes recommended maintenance  intervals  based  upon  engineering  testing  to"}
